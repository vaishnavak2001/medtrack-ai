      # Note: Adjusting PWD to subfolder if repo is root, but here we are in a subfolder inside repo?
      # The user setup is creating MediForge-v5-Free INSIDE medtrack-ai.
      # So we need to handle paths carefully.
      # If this workflow is inside MediForge-v5-Free/.github/workflows, it runs relative to Repo Root.
      # So we probably need to CD into MediForge-v5-Free for npm commands.
